# 2.4 Compare the functionality, benefits, and uses of OpenConfig, IETF, and native YANG models


## OpenConfig

- Standard models defined by a group of operators (not vendors) that are standard across vendors/platforms

## IETF

- Models defined by the IETF standards body
- Some models may be platform-specific

## Native

- Vendor-specific
- Platform-specific
- Will likely be able to provide more data than OpenConfig or IETF models
